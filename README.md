# Level 4 Task 25 -Introduction to Node.js

## Task 1

Install Node.js and create a Node.js file called HelloWorld.js.

This code should create a web server that returns a web page that says “Hey! I can use Node!”. Your web server should listen for HTTP requests on port 3000.

## Task 2

● Create a module called palin.js with a function that finds and returns all the palindromic numbers between 1 and 1000.

A palindromic number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g. 1551; 676; 77

● Create a module called div7.js with a function that returns all numbers divisible by 7 between 1 and 100.

● Create a Node.js file called my_numbers.js that uses the number modules that you created. The program should:

○ Write the word “Palindromes:” and then the numbers returned by palin.js in a text file called nums.txt.

○ It should then append the heading “Div7s:” and the numbers returned by div7.js to nums.txt.

○ Write a message to the console that indicates whether the file was created successfully or not.

○ Read nums.txt and display the contents of this file in the browser when the user navigates to http://localhost:8000/

● Create a module called delete_file.js that will delete nums.txt when called.

● Delete the file immediately after displaying its contents from above.
